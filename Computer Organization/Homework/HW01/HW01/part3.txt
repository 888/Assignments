1. To divide a multi-bit input into several (single or multi-bit) outputs which can be individually evaluated. Also to combine multiple (single or multi-bit) inputs into a single multi-bit output which can then be collectively evaulated.
2. To simplify the Logisim circuits, by replacing wires and thereby reducing the visual clutter. 
3. Output of 010 is 0. Output of 100 is 0. 
3a. My circuit is arranged such that the bottom two wires connect to the AND, instead of the top two like in the screenshots.
3b. If my circuit was wired exactly like the screenshots, output of 010 would be 0 and output of 100 would be 1.
