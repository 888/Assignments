Substitute HashSet for MySet and CoinBook to test 




MySet

1. The class MySet has its own equals method, but do we also need to override Object's equals method (b/c it is used in contains method to check if two Objects/Coins are equal, etc).
	Yes, override equals methods for set in MySet, override equals methods for Objects in Coin or w/e the class is. Done
2. Constructor for MySet? Is it the backingArray? (b/c need to instantiate new double-size Array when indexes are full)
	Yes Done
3. Can the clear() method just set all elements to null?
	Yes Done

4. When and how to use Iterator (addAll, containsAll........?)
	Use foreach loops Done

6. Is it alright to implement remove() method so that it sets element to null? Should indices be shifted?
	Yes fill in gap Done

7. Are the "if (..... != null) conditionals necessary or can I just try and execute and let a NullPointerException be thrown automatically? Or should I add an "else" and explicitly throw one?
	Unnecessary Done

8. How to check all the elements in Iterator? Do I just have to explicitly call the [0] index? because hasNext and next will start with [1] index.
	use foreach Done

9. How to do toArray? .clone() method? Or should we write a deepcopy function ourselves?
	Dont need to copy the actual Objects in the array, just copy references in a new Array Done

PENDING

10. Compiler yells at me about the foreach loop and c.toArray() being filled with Objects, T incompatible with Object, can just use for (Object element : c)?

11. Because of #10, T and Object incompatible in add(), can just cast element as T?


MySet Tester

1. Can use Arrays for addAll, containsAll methods (b/c used in given code), but HW 5 docs say not to use Arrays?
	Fine

Coin
1. Should the given method hashCode() have a javadoc? 
	NO

Penny, Nickel, Dime

1. Should penny, quarter, dime, etc, have any instance variables at all?
NO

2. Shoudl they have anything else besides a constructor and a toString() method? 
	NO

Quarter

1. How to compare which state comes earlier in the alphabet? 
ENUM

2. How to find other's state? Should we have a getter method for state?
Yes

3. How to override compareTo method to account for non-Quarter coins?
super

MagicCoin

1. How to limit user input for value to between 26 and 100? 
Done 

CoinBook

1. How to format constructor, and initialize the Set/MySet coinBook?
	Done 

2. Connection between type T and type Coin? Can Coinbook use methods from MySet? (add, remove, etc) 
	T is placeholder 
3. Does CoinBook implement Comparator? 
	No, use inner class
4. Should CoinBook import List? 
	Yes
5. How to implement sortByValue and sortByYear methods?

6. How to implement toString() method?

7. The huge amount of casting in sortByValue? 
	N/A

8. The huge number of import statements?
