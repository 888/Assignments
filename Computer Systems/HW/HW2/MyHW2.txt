1.a.





1. Return from interrupt is broken into four parts:
	a. Disable interrupts
	b. Restore $k0
	c. Re-enable interrupts
	d. JALR back to return address
It must be atomic because RETI is composed of multiple operations that must be executed in sequence without another interrupt(s) within the interrupt, so they are made atomic. 

2. IVT is populated by the manufacturer and holds all interrupts resulting from all discontinuities (exceptions, traps, and interrupts). 
Exception/Trap register is used to contain the current interrupt, from the IVT.
