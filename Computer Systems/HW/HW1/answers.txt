c. 1. Caller saves the data in the t-registers on the stack. 
     2. The parameters for the function call are saved in a-registers and then passed onto the stack, if necessary. 
     3. Caller saves the return address in $ra.
     4. Control is transferred to the callee using JAL, by changing the PC to the callee's address. 
     5. Callee allocates space on the stack for any necessary local variables, by shifting the stack pointer. 
     6. Callee stores return values in $v0.
     7. Jump back to the address indicated by $ra, and return control to the caller by updating the PC.
